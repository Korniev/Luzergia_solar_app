At the core of the final project, I decided to demo a solar panel mobile app for the company's customers.
Basic functionality:
1) Authentication processes.
2) Database with the numbers of energy that the customer has generated and consumed.
and consumed
3) Logistic order process with push notifications.
4) Customer feedback to the company
5) User-friendly profile
6) Possibility to choose between dark and light theme
7) 3 languages to choose from in the app - English, Spanish, Catalan.


When I had already started the course, my friends from a not so big solar panel installation company asked me to develop a mobile application that would cover their basic needs. The main functionality of the application was to work with APIs from SemsPortal and Englighten Manager. Since the company has a database of customers who, after installing solar panels, had access to two websites where they could track how much the solar panels had generated and how much energy the customers had consumed.
To do this, I had to contact the technical support of the Chinese company responsible for the website and the issuance of API keys.
Unfortunately, this process took longer than I would have expected and, at the end of the course, I still did not have an API.... So I had to adapt to the circumstances and reformat a bit the functionality of the project.

<!-- Evolution and future of the project -->
## Evolution and future of the project

Now I would like to talk about how the application can be improved and made more useful.
Firstly, I would like to take up the idea that I will eventually be given access to the API so that I can work with the data from the platform where the actual customer data is hosted through the API.
Secondly, I would also internationalize the application: I would add 3-4 more languages for more specific use depending on the country the person is from.
Third, I would add the functionality to store and view electricity bills to have access to everything related to energy in one place.
Fourth, for users who have car chargers installed, I would add the ability to actually see the amount of charge and how much time is left to fully charge the car.
